The sensor creates a characteristic fingerprint of the measured object (skin). Used on different regions of human skin this technology allows us to distinguish between different metabolic states and make predictions about metabolic parameters. 
 
 b) machine learning: As well as a biological tongue is not able to classify a certain taste appropriately without a trained neural network – the brain - our electronic tongue has to do the same. A single measurement is worthless without a strong knowledge set behind. Deep learning technology enables us to cluster incoming datasets, classify different metabolic states and predict metabolic parameters.
